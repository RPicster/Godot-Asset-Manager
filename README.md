# Godot Asset Manager
A Plugin to make game creation in Godot faster, easier and more straightforward! The first version was developed by Guy Unger and development was continued by myself.

## Installation:
- Copy the addon folder to your Godot project folder
- Activate the plugin in the Project Settings
- Ready to go!


## Usage and setting up a structure
The plugin works with a folder structure, it is separated into three main categories:
- Game Objects (Things like Enemies, Collectibles, Dangers, Player, etc.)
- Deco (Decorational things like props, trees, etc.)
- Levels (This can be used to organize and easily access your levels and maps


To get started, create a new directory inside these three main directories and then add Opened Scenes using the Star Button in the upper left of the 2D Viewport toolbar.

To sort the directories, you can add 01_XXX 02_XXX, these prefixes will not be displayed in the Asset Manager.



## Controls
After dragging an item from the Asset Manager into your workspace, you can hold **SHIFT** to place the item multiple times.

Pressing **RIGHT MOUSEBUTTON or ESCAPE** cancels placement

Pressing **CTLR** while dragging switches between instanced mode and normal mode

While in instanced mode, you can use the **MOUSE WHEEL UP/DOWN** to rotate the item before placing it.
